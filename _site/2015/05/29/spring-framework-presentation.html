## Expert One-on-One J2EE Development without EJB
* Architectural principles on how to solve core problems:
  * Transaction management, persistence, remoting, and Web tier design
* Leveraging practical techniques and tools in order to create a lightweight architecture;

---

### Version 1.0
* ***AOP interception*** framework based on the AOP Alliance interfaces, integrated with the core container
* ***JNDI support classes***, allowing for easy wiring of Spring-managed beans with JNDI-located objects
* ***Application context concept***, providing resource loading and message access abstractions
* ***Generic transaction management*** with pluggable strategies, supporting declarative and programmatic demarcation
* Support for ***source-level metadata***, with Commons Attributes as default implementation (e.g. for transaction attributes)

--

* ***Generic DAO support***, providing a generic data access exception hierarchy for use with any data access strategy
* ***JDBC abstraction*** that simplifies resource and error handling, also covering BLOB/CLOB support
* ***Hibernate support***, providing SessionFactory management and transaction-scoped ThreadLocal Sessions
* Support classes for ***JDO 1.0 and iBATIS*** SQL Maps 1.3/2.0, integrated with Spring’s transaction management
* ***Mail sender abstraction***, with special support for JavaMail including convenient handling of file attachments

--

* ***Scheduling support for Quartz and Timer***, making it easy to invoke methods of Spring-managed beans
* ***Remoting support for RMI, JAX-RPC*** and Caucho’s Hessian/Burlap, for easy exposure of Spring-managed beans
* Convenience classes for ***accessing and implementing EJBs***, both local and remote
* ***Web application context***, for loading a Spring application context in a web environment
* ***Flexible web MVC framework***, built on strategy interfaces and integrated with various view technologies

### Pivotal = SpringSource + Vmware + EMC + GE

* Interface 21 - Rod Johnson
* SpringSource + Covalent = $$$
* SpringSource + G2One = Flexibility
* SpringSource + Hyperic = Gets to the cloud
* SpringSource + Cloud Foundry = PaaS ready
* Now SpringSource is inside the: Apache Tomcat, Apache HTTP Server, Hyperic, Groovy, and Grails  Java Community Process communities

--

* August 2009 VMware buys SpringCloud for $ 420M
* And create the vFabric Application Suite
  * Among the vFabric products acquire:
    * RabbitMQ
    * Redis
    * GemStone
* Then Pivotal rises as a joint venture


---

### Version 4.0
* Java 8 (as well as 6 and 7)
  * Lambda expressions and method references with Spring’s callback interfaces
  * There is first-class support for java.time (JSR-310)
  * Several existing annotations have been retrofitted as @Repeatable
  * Java 8’s parameter name discovery (based on the -parameters compiler flag) as an alternative to compiling your code with debug information enabled.
  * Remains compatible with older versions of Java and the JDK

--

* Java EE
  * JPA 2.0 and Servlet 3.0
* Supports the Java EE 7 level of applicable specifications:
  * JMS 2.0
  * JTA 1.2
  * JPA 2.1
  * Bean Validation 1.1
  * JSR-236 Concurrency Utilities

--

* Groovy Bean Definition DSL as XML replacement
```groovy
def reader = new GroovyBeanDefinitionReader(myApplicationContext)
reader.beans {
    dataSource(BasicDataSource) {
        driverClassName = "org.hsqldb.jdbcDriver"
        url = "jdbc:hsqldb:mem:grailsDB"
        username = "sa"
        password = ""
        settings = [mynew:"setting"]
    }
    sessionFactory(SessionFactory) {
        dataSource = dataSource
    }
    myService(MyService) {
        nestedBean = { AnotherBean bean ->
            dataSource = dataSource
        }
    }
}
```

--

* Core Container Improvements:
* General Web Improvements
* WebSocket, SockJS, and STOMP Messaging
* Testing Improvements
